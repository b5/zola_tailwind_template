### base template for zola + tailwind site
    
This should be a good jumping off point for building sites with zola. 
I started with this [blog post](https://www.maybevain.com/writing/using-tailwind-css-with-zola-static-site-generator/) as a reference, but numerous things are out of date because javascript. 
From there, built out the bones of a template using https://github.com/tchartron/blow as a reference.

## Getting started
You'll need [`zola`](https://getzola.org), [`node`](), and [`yarn`]()

```
$ git clone git@github.com:b5/zola_tailwind_template.git
$ cd zola_tailwind_template
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

then visit `127.0.0.1:1111` in a browser
